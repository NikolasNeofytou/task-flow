# Course Documentation Index

This directory curates only the files relevant to the HCI course work for this Flutter app. Everything else (e.g., legacy big_project drafts or node_modules docs) is left in place but can be ignored.

## What to read
- App setup and backend
  - `../api_config.md` – how to point the app at mock/real endpoints
  - `../backend_mock.md` – mock backend endpoints and run instructions
- Design and theming
  - `../design-tokens.md` – color/spacing/typography tokens
  - `../flutter_checklist.md` – daily dev checklist and lint/testing notes
- Release and progress
  - `../release_checklist.md` – ship checklist
  - `../progress.md` – running log of changes

## What to ignore for this course submission
- `big_project/` and its subfolders (`wireframes`, `final_deliverable`): old drafts and templates not used in this build.
- Any markdown files inside `backend_mock/node_modules`: package docs only.

If you add new course-related docs, place them here or link them from this index to keep the set clean.
